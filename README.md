# React JWT Authentication Example

This is a simple example project that demonstrates how to implement JWT authentication in a React application using React Router.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components and functionalities:

- **Authentication**: Users can log in and receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) upon successful login. The JWT is stored in the browser's local storage.

- **Protected Routes**: Certain routes are protected and can only be accessed by authenticated users with specific roles.

- **Role-Based Authorization**: Users have roles associated with their JWT. Access to protected routes is determined based on these roles.

- **Navigation**: Users are redirected to an unauthorized page if they attempt to access restricted routes without the necessary roles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v7 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>

### Future Enhancements

As a future enhancement, consider implementing the following:

- **API Link in .env**: Store the API endpoint in an environment variable (`.env` file) for better configuration management.

- **Refactor Contexts**: Refactor the context management to improve context separation and organization.

- **User Registration**: Implement user registration functionality to allow new users to create accounts.

- **User Profile**: Create a user profile page where users can view and update their profile information.

- **Password Reset**: Implement a password reset mechanism for users who forget their passwords.
